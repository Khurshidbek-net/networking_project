# Warehouse Management System

## CI/CD Setup

This project uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. The pipeline includes:

### Continuous Integration (CI)
- Automated testing
- Code linting
- Database migrations
- Prisma client generation

### Continuous Deployment (CD)
- Automatic deployment to production when merging to main branch
- Database migrations
- Docker container deployment

## Required Secrets

Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

- `DATABASE_URL`: Your production database connection string
- `HEROKU_API_KEY`: Your Heroku API key
- `HEROKU_APP_NAME`: Your Heroku application name
- `HEROKU_EMAIL`: Your Heroku email address

## Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development environment using Docker:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Run database migrations:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

5. Generate Prisma Client:
```bash
npx prisma generate
```

## Deployment

The application automatically deploys to production when changes are merged into the main branch. The deployment process:

1. Runs all tests
2. Builds the Docker container
3. Deploys to Heroku
4. Runs database migrations

## Manual Deployment

If you need to deploy manually:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t warehouse-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 warehouse-app
```

## Database Migrations

To create a new migration:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name your_migration_name
```

To apply migrations in production:

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

## Monitoring

- CI/CD pipeline status can be monitored in the GitHub Actions tab
- Production logs can be viewed in your Heroku dashboard
- Database migration status can be checked using Prisma CLI
